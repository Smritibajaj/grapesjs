Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean|String} [droppable=true] Indicates if it's possible to drop other components inside. You can use\r\n * a query string as with `draggable`.

Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean|Array<String>} [stylable=true] True if it's possible to style the component.\r\n * You can also indicate an array of CSS properties which is possible to style, eg. `['color', 'width']`, all other properties\r\n * will be hidden from the style manager.

Default: `false`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [editable=false] Allow to edit the content of the component (used on Text components). Default: `false`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [layerable=true] Set to `false` if you need to hide the component inside Layers. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [selectable=true] Allow component to be selected when clicked. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [hoverable=true] Shows a highlight outline when hovering on the element if `true`. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [void=false] This property is used by the HTML exporter as void elements don't have closing tags, eg. `<br/>`, `<hr/>`, etc. Default: `false`\r\n * @property {String} [content=''] Content of the component (not escaped) which will be appended before children rendering. Default: `''`\r\n * @property {String} [icon=''] Component's icon, this string will be inserted before the name (in Layers and badge), eg. it can be an HTML string '<i class=\"fa fa-square-o\"></i>'. Default: `''`\r\n * @property {String|Function} [script=''] Component's javascript. More about it [here](/modules/Components-js.html). Default: `''`\r\n * @property {String|Function} [script-export=''] You can specify javascript available only in export functions (eg. when you get the HTML).\r\n * If this property is defined it will overwrite the `script` one (in export functions). Default: `''`\r\n * @property {Array<Object|String>} [traits=''] Component's traits. More about it [here](/modules/Traits.html). Default: `['id', 'title']`\r\n * @property {Array<String>} [propagate=[]] Indicates an array of properties which will be inhereted by all NEW appended children.\r\n *  For example if you create a component likes this: `{ removable: false, draggable: false, propagate: ['removable', 'draggable'] }`\r\n *  and append some new component inside, the new added component will get the exact same properties indicated in the `propagate` array (and the `propagate` property itself). Default: `[]`\r\n * @property {Array<Object>} [toolbar=null] Set an array of items to show up inside the toolbar when the component is selected (move, clone, delete).\r\n * Eg. `toolbar: [ { attributes: {class: 'fa fa-arrows'}, command: 'tlb-move' }, ... ]`.\r\n * By default, when `toolbar` property is falsy the editor will add automatically commands like `move`, `delete`, etc. based on its properties.\r\n * @property {Collection<Component>} [components=null] Children components.
